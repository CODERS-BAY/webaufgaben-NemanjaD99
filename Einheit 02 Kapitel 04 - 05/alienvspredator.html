Aliens versus Predator: Extinction is a real-time strategy
game with a focus on unit management over base-building and resource gathering. 
Each species has a single resource that is used to summon or upgrade units,
and methods of unit generation differ radically.  
Players must move through specific objectives in order to advance a level,
ranging from killing certain enemies or performing tasks like repairing an object.
Starting conditions are often dependent on story developments. 
Each species has a population cap that varies by level.
The population cost of units varies drastically between species. 
Human units, appearing in the game as the US Colonial Marines,
gain credits by killing enemies and repairing atmospheric processors. 
These credits can be spent on upgrading existing units or calling in new ones via dropship,
which drop units off at specific landing beacons. Marine units are entirely medium to long range fighters and
have support units to perform specific actions that aren't available to humans like other species (such as healing). 
Predator units can only gain resources by killing opponents, which is granted via an "honor" system. 
As the units gain honor, more units can be summoned via drop pods.
Predators can self-heal and cloak themselves, but deplete energy reserves when doing so. 
There is only one Predator support unit, which improves the rate of energy regeneration. 
Alien units gain resources by either killing or immobilizing opponents,
which can be used on upgrades to specific units. 
Unlike humans and Predators, Aliens cannot summon specific units at will and
must instead bring corresponding host species to their hive to infest them. 
All Aliens, with the exception of "pure-bred" strains, have specific hosts that generate them.
In order to generate eggs that can infest host units, Aliens must maintain a queen unit at their hive. 
This queen continuously lays eggs until the population cap has been reached. 
The single player campaign spans 21 missions, with 7 levels per species. </pre>

<h3>General Tips</h3>
<p id="GT">These tips are designed to relate to all three species. For species-specific tips, strengths and weaknesses, see the section for that particular character.</p>
<br>
<ul id="GT" >
    <li>In order to get the feel for the game, it's absolutely essential that you go through the basic and species-specific tutorials. They're relatively short and succinct, and give you the knowledge about how to perform specific functions that you're going to desperately need in the game.</li>
    <li>If you find yourself constantly routed by the enemy, set the difficulty down to easy. I know, I don't like doing it either, but this game, especially later on, gets ridiculously difficult. You'll have a much more enjoyable gaming experience if you play on easy the first time through. </li>
<li>Throughout 90 percent of the game, the best formation for your team is the "Clump." That's right, just cram everybody into the smallest space possible, with your weakest characters in the center. Splitting up your team into individual squads is, in most cases, a recipe for death. </li>
<li>After the first couple missions, objective markers become few and far between, leaving you wandering a huge map looking for the place you're supposed to go. When this happens, your objective is often at the furthest point possible from your landing zone. For example, if you start in the northwest corner of the map, odds are that the place you need to go is in the southeast corner, and so on.</li>
<li>Upgrade, Upgrade, Upgrade. As soon as your team is strong enough to not get immediately killed, upgrade all your troops even if it means doing with a few less soldiers for a while. Depending on the species and unit type, an upgrade can turn a relatively weak unit, like the Comm Tech, into something capable of dealing significant damage.</li>
<li>Whenever possible, increase your team numbers all the way to the population cap before you go looking for trouble. Superior numbers is often the only way to win in this game, especially with the Aliens.</li>
<li>Take the time to read over the Bestiary in the pause menu before you start building your team. Pay close attention to the Strengths and Weaknesses section, as well as the stats to determine exactly which soldiers will suit you best given the enemy you're fighting.</li>
<li>Don't expect to make the objective times on very many of the missions the first time through, at least not without reading the walkthrough portion of this guide. That time presumes that you know exactly where to go, and don't spend twenty minutes dragging your humans around the map to look for a specific enemy.</li>
<li>For detailed information about how to use the various species, view the pretty-darned informative tutorial missions. They're really quite handy.</li>
